The goal of this program translates Hack assembly into binary code

Here are steps to run the assembler:

1. Use the Makefile command "make" in your terminal to compile all files
2. Then use ./main filename.asm (such as add.asm)
2.1. Then too access the .asm you must navigate through the folders /filename/filename.asm
3. Once ran (./main filename.asm) in the directory of your filename.asm, you should see filename.asm.hack
